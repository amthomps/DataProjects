# Analyze Particles
This is a short analysis in ImageJ and R demonstrating the ImageJ built-in function *Analyze Particles.*  In this project, I extract size and fluorescence intensity information from a fluorescence microscopy image of single cells using an ImageJ macro, then compare fluorescence intensity of cells under multiple experimental conditions.

In GitHub, click this file to view the walkthrough.   
* **CellIntensityAnalysis.txt**  
This is a copy of the ImageJ macro used to extract the area and intensity of fluorescent cells in the image.  The thresholds, particle size/circularity, and flat-field image are specific to the images in this folder and would need to be changed for other setups.
* **Cell_Intensity_Analysis.Rmd**  
This is the R script used in the walkthrough.  
* **20180118-flat-field-zoom-125-test4.tif**
The flat field image used by the ImageJ macro.
* **-Other images and csv's-**  
The raw images and the csv's produced by the ImageJ macro.

# DataProjects
This is a collection of short data science projects I completed as part of data science coursework or just playing around trying to learn new tools.  

## Contents  
* **Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey**  
This is a guided project from [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/74).  
Most of the markdown and commented-out code were provided, and I filled in the rest of the code.  Everything was checked by the Data Camp system.  
* **Clinical Trials Gov Scraper**  
This is an incomplete project I am working on.  I would like to be able to pull data from a search of clinicaltrials.gov, for instance search "diabetes", and extract some info from each trial (study title, condition, intervention, trial phase).  I would like to be able to see at any time what the trends are in diabetes trials, i.e. proportion of type 1 vs. type 2 vs. gestational diabetes, drug vs. device interventions, etc.  I currently can extract the necessary info from a single url. :)
